The edges of the power strips, adapters, and cables are smooth and continuous, with no signs of unnatural pixel distribution or jagged edges that would indicate tampering. The resolution across the image is uniform, without any areas of blurring or compression that would suggest editing. The perspective is coherent, with the power strips and their adapters proportionally sized and positioned as expected in a three-dimensional space. There are no violations of physical laws, and the text on the power strip adapters is clear and consistent with the environment.

It appears to be a photograph taken directly by a camera without any evident signs of tampering.\n\n2. Judgment basis: The image shows a consistent lighting source, with the shadows falling naturally to the right, suggesting a light source from the left. The colors and textures are uniform across the image, and there are no obvious signs of copy and paste, such as repeated patterns or mirrored sections. The edges of the boxes and the products are smooth and continuous, with no unnatural pixel distribution or jagged edges that would indicate manipulation. The resolution across the image is consistent, without areas of differing quality or signs of compression that would suggest editing. The perspective is coherent, with the boxes appearing as they would in a three-dimensional space, and the scale of objects is consistent with a typical retail setting. The shadows under the boxes are appropriate for the lighting conditions, and there are no unrealistic reflections. The text on the boxes is clear, legible, and conforms to the contours of the boxes, which is expected in an unaltered photo. Lastly, there are no violations of physical laws; everything in the image adheres to real-world expectations."

Judgment basis: The lighting in the image is consistent, with the shadows falling in a natural direction that suggests a single light source. The colors and brightness levels across the various objects in the image are uniform, indicating that the photo has not been altered in terms of lighting. There are no obvious signs of duplication or mirroring that would suggest a copy and paste operation. The edges of the objects are smooth and continuous, with no unnatural pixel distribution or jagged edges that would indicate tampering. The resolution across the image is consistent, without any areas of blurring or compression that would be expected if parts of the image had been edited or composited. The perspective and scale relationships among the different items in the image are realistic and follow the laws of physics. The depth of field is consistent, with no unnatural vignetting. The reflections and shadows in the photograph are appropriate for the light source and the physical environment. Any text or logos present in the image are clear and consistent with their surroundings. There are no violations of physical laws or unnatural trajectories or reflections. All these factors contribute to the assessment that this image is real and has not been tampered with."

The text on the sign is clear, legible, and conforms to the perspective and angles of the sign itself, which suggests that it has not been artificially placed or altered. The edges of the sign and the frame are smooth and continuous, with no signs of unnatural pixel distribution or jagged edges that would indicate tampering. The resolution of the image is consistent throughout, with no areas of blurring or compression that would suggest manipulation. The perspective is coherent, with the sign appearing as a flat object on a surface, and the scale of the text and frame is appropriate for the scene. There are no violations of physical laws or unnatural reflections that would indicate photo tampering. Overall, the image presents a real scenario with no visible signs of digital alteration."

Judgment basis: The image shows two identical promotional posters for an event, placed on a wooden table with a patterned surface. The lighting in the image is consistent, with the shadows under the posters indicating a light source from above, which is typical for indoor lighting. The reflections on the table surface are consistent with the glossiness of the wood and the way light interacts with it. The edges of the posters and the table are sharp and show no signs of unnatural pixel distribution or editing. The resolution of the image is uniform across the entire scene, with no areas of blurring or jaggedness that would suggest manipulation.

Whether the picture has been tampered with / Description of the tampered area: The picture has been tampered with, specifically in the central region of the image, where there is a circular plate with a pattern of alternating yellow and orange stripes and a white background. The tampering is located on the upper half of this plate, slightly to the right of the center.\n\n2. Judgment basis: The tampered area has a noticeable difference in texture and pattern compared to the surrounding area of the plate, which suggests a copy and paste manipulation. The edges of the tampered area are unnaturally smooth and lack the continuity of the plate's design, indicating that the original content may have been removed or altered. Additionally, the lighting on the tampered area does not match the rest of the image; it lacks the reflective quality that is present on the rest of the plate, which could be due to the tampering process. The perspective of the tampered area also seems inconsistent with the rest of the plate, as the lines do not follow the curvature that would be expected from the plate's design."
