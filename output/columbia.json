The objects appear to be under a different light source.\n- Edges: The edges of the tampered area, especially around the bottles and the counter, are unnaturally sharp and exhibit a lack of smooth transition into the surrounding area.\n- Perspective relationship: The perspective of the tampered objects seems inconsistent with the rest of the image. The size and angle of the items on the counter do not align with the perspective of the room.\n- Shadows: The shadows cast by the objects in the tampered area do not correspond with the lighting in the rest of the image, suggesting they were not originally part of the scene.\n- Physical laws: The placement and orientation of the objects in the tampered area seem to defy gravity, as they are positioned in a way that does not appear to be stable or naturally placed on the counter."

The tampered area is located in the central portion of the image, extending from the middle to the right side, and includes a portion of the door frame and the wall adjacent to it. The content within this tampered area appears to be a distorted and unnatural image of a green object that resembles a shoe, with a portion of a yellow object that could be a banana overlapping it.\n\n2. Judgment basis: The tampering is evident due to several factors:\n- Lighting: The lighting on the green object does not match the rest of the scene, which is more uniformly lit.\n- Edges: The edges of the green object and the yellow object are unnaturally sharp and exhibit a different pixel distribution compared to the surrounding areas.\n- Resolution: The tampered area has a different resolution and level of detail compared to the rest of the image, indicating a possible composite.\n- Perspective relationship: The perspective of the green object and the yellow object does not align with the rest of the environment, suggesting that they were not originally part of the scene.\n- Shadows: There are no consistent shadows cast by the green object or the yellow object, which would be expected if they were naturally present in the scene.\n- Physical laws: The appearance of the green object and the yellow object defies the physical laws of reflection and texture, as they do not conform to the expected appearance of objects in this setting."

This circular area is located on the floor, slightly to the left of the center of the image, and is surrounded by a pattern of black and white checkered tiles.\n\n2. Judgment basis: The tampering is evident due to the following reasons:\n- Lighting: The lighting on the tampered circular area does not match the rest of the image. The surrounding area has a consistent light source, while the tampered section appears to be uniformly lit without any shadows or highlights that would suggest depth or texture.\n- Edges: The edges of the tampered area are unnaturally smooth and do not blend seamlessly with the surrounding checkered pattern. The transition between the tampered area and the original floor is abrupt, lacking the gradual change in texture and color that would be expected in an untouched photo.\n- Resolution: The tampered area has a different resolution compared to the rest of the image. It lacks the detailed texture of the checkered pattern and the natural variation in shading and detail that is present in the rest of the photo.\n- Perspective relationship: The tampered area does not follow the same perspective as the checkered pattern. The lines of the tiles within the tampered area do not converge towards a vanishing point as they do in the rest of the image, suggesting that the area has been artificially placed or altered.\n- Shadows: There are no shadows within the tampered area that would be consistent with the lighting in the rest of the image.

The edges of objects, such as the chairs, walls, and floor, are natural and show no signs of unnatural pixel distribution or inconsistent edges. The resolution of the image is uniform throughout, with no areas of unnatural pixel blurring or jaggedness. The perspective and scale relationships within the image are realistic; the size of the objects decreases consistently with distance, and the angles of the walls and floor tiles align with a single vanishing point, as expected in a real photograph. The depth of field is reasonable, with the focus gradually softening towards the background. There are no reflections or shadows that contradict the light source, and any text or logos present in the image (such as on the book cover) are legible and consistent with their surroundings. Finally, there is no content in the picture that violates physical laws. All these factors contribute to the conclusion that the image is real and has not been tampered with."

The tampered area is located in the central region of the image, covering a portion of the Dell computer's brand logo and the area immediately surrounding it.\n\n2. Judgment basis: The tampering is evident due to the presence of a circular area with a distinctly different pixel pattern, which does not match the rest of the image. This circular region has a blurred and smudged appearance, which is inconsistent with the sharpness and clarity of the surrounding area, including the Dell logo and the adjacent buttons on the computer. The edges of the tampered area are unnaturally smooth and do not align with the natural lines and textures of the computer's surface. Additionally, the lighting and shadows within the tampered area do not match the rest of the image, as there is a lack of consistent shadowing that would be expected from the surrounding light sources."

The lighting on the ducky does not match the rest of the scene, as it has a more pronounced shadow on its underside, suggesting a light source from above, which is not consistent with the ambient lighting in the hallway. Additionally, the edges around the ducky are slightly blurred and do not blend seamlessly with the background, indicating a possible composite. The perspective of the ducky also seems off; it does not follow the same vanishing points as the posters on the wall, which would normally converge towards a point on the horizon. The ducky's size and placement do not conform to the perspective of the room, making it appear as if it is floating without any support."

The tampered area is located in the central portion of the image, extending from the middle to the right side, and includes a stack of books and papers on a shelf. The books are titled \"Shaping the Future of Asian Education\" and \"Feelings Conference on Asian Education.\"\n\n2. Judgment basis: The tampering is evident due to several factors:\n- Lighting: The lighting on the tampered books does not match the rest of the scene. The books appear to have a different light source, as they are brighter and have a different contrast compared to the surrounding area.\n- Edges: The edges of the tampered books and papers are unnaturally sharp and exhibit a slight halo effect, which is indicative of a cut-and-paste operation.\n- Resolution: The tampered area has a different resolution compared to the rest of the image. The books and papers appear to be of higher resolution, which is inconsistent with the slightly blurrier surroundings.\n- Perspective relationship: The perspective of the tampered books does not quite align with the rest of the items on the shelf. The angle and position of the books seem slightly off, suggesting they were not originally part of the scene.\n- Shadows: The shadows cast by the tampered books do not match the direction and quality of the shadows in the rest of the image, indicating that the books were likely added into the scene.\n- Physical laws: The way the books are stacked seems unnatural. The books are leaning at an angle that does not seem to be supported by the shelf or the items around them, defying the physical laws of balance and support."
