The shadows are consistent with the direction of the light source, and the color tones match the natural lighting conditions during sunset. There are no obvious signs of duplication or mirroring that would suggest a copy and paste operation. The edges of objects, such as the umbrella and the horizon line, are smooth and continuous, with no unnatural pixel distribution or jagged edges. The resolution of the image is consistent throughout, without any areas of unnatural blurring or compression artifacts. The perspective and scale relationships within the image are realistic, with the size of the umbrella and the horizon line diminishing into the distance as expected. The depth of field is reasonable, with the focus gradually softening in the distance. The reflections on the water are appropriate for the light source and the physical properties of water. There is no text or logos present to assess for tampering. Lastly, there are no violations of physical laws; the scene depicted follows the expected natural behavior of light and shadow, perspective, and reflections."

This solid block does not match the rest of the image, which is in grayscale tones and shows detail. The edges of the tampered area are unnaturally straight and do not conform to the natural contours that would be expected in an untouched photograph of a person. Additionally, the lighting and shadows on the tampered area do not match the rest of the image, as there are no shadows or highlights that would suggest depth or texture. The tampered area lacks the continuity of the scene, disrupting the natural flow of the image."
