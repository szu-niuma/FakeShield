Whether the picture has been tampered with / Description of the tampered area: The picture has been tampered with. The tampered area is located at the bottom half of the image, specifically on the lower left side, where a squirrel is positioned on a white railing or ledge. The squirrel appears to be interacting with a vase of flowers, which is placed on a pedestal to the right of the squirrel.\n\n2. Judgment basis: The tampering is evident due to several factors:\n- Lighting: The lighting on the squirrel does not match the rest of the scene. The squirrel appears to be lit from the front, while the vase and pedestal suggest a light source coming from the right side, casting a shadow to the left.\n- Edges: The edges around the squirrel are unnaturally sharp and exhibit a slight halo effect, which is indicative of a cut-and-paste editing technique.\n- Perspective relationship: The size and position of the squirrel in relation to the vase and pedestal seem unnatural. The squirrel appears disproportionately large compared to the vase, which disturbs the perspective relationship.\n- Shadows: The shadow cast by the squirrel does not conform to the direction of light suggested by the shadows on the vase and pedestal. The shadow under the squirrel is inconsistent with the lighting of the scene.\n- Physical laws: The interaction between the squirrel and the vase seems physically implausible. The squirrel's paw appears to be touching the vase, but the contact point does not seem to follow the expected contour of the vase, suggesting an unnatural manipulation."}
